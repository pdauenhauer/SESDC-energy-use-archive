            "the kiosk was installed beginning Sept. 14, 2015. Wiring errors were discovered and corrected on Oct. 24, 2016. The errors affected the energy meters (kiosk, lights, house 1 and house 2).  House 1 and House 2 were connected to kiosk on approximately February 10, 2016. House 1 previously served a church, however, their usage was very low and the meter was repurposed to measure House 1 consumption. However, because the meter is not able to be reset, the legacy consumption from the church appears as an offset of 191 pulses for House 1. The owner of House 1 was unable to afford to pay for energy for long periods, so the consumption is stagnant for several weeks. Beginning in June, the consumption increases. The meter for House 2 was originally a spare meter. It was wired on 27 February.",
            "The energy kiosk outlet meter appears to have stopped sending regular pulses starting approximately March 1, 2016.",
            " Some sensors have a DC offset (bias) that is requires correction (for example, small non-zero solar current values at night). The inverter offset is 0.0097, which is not accounted for in the data set."],
